# ONBOARDING FACILITATOR


## Overview {-}

  
Trinity Western University (TWU) is a Christian liberal art university based in Langley British Columbia, Canada. The university has campuses in other parts of the province and the country. Internationally, Trinity provides academic services in China and the USA. As part of its Global Outreach, the university adopted the FAR Center model.  FAR centers are educational facilities providing online-based courses and degrees from a physically remote location. At the heart of the FAR center model is the Academic Facilitator. The facilitator is the liaison between the university, the instructor, the content, the host university, and the students. Facilitators serve as coaches to the students, preparing them to meet the academic standard of TWU in terms of learning requirements.

Although Trinity's process of hiring facilitators is meticulous, and the facilitation guide provides helpful suggestions about facilitation, the university could improve in the facilitators' onboarding journey and Training. Specifically, TWU should make sure that facilitators understand their role in the context of the Global FAR Center so that they are ready to facilitate before their first class.

The purpose of the present Unit is to develop a Facilitator Orientation and Onboarding Training (FOOT).  
The goals of FOOT are to: 
â€¢ Understand
